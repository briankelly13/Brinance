* Future patterns in futures file; patterns like minder

* Maybe add the ability to automagically calculate interest.. Be^(rt) and all..

* GTK - use glade..

* Add less specific dates in dated functions; '-B 1217' means at 12:17pm today,
   '-B 04301835' means at 6:35pm of April 30th of this year, etc.. <DONE>
	- always show date of dated transaction**

* Add summary option - show all account balances and names
	- optional account number range? some way to categorize accounts (100s are
credit payoffs, 200s are vacation savers, 300s are christmas/borthday savers,
etc..)
	- need to change file handling -- read accounts into a data structure, only
manipulate there, write new file if necessary
