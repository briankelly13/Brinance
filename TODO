* Change the file format: <date><sp><account><sp><amount><sp><comment>
	One trans per line
	Would have to include a conversion script
	New versions would have to detect and warn about old format
	- Consolidate all accounts to one file by indicating account on each line
	- Future and past all in one file
	- Future file only contains recurring patterns now (like in minder)
	- Deprecate dated methods, allow balance and trans to take a date or not
	- CLI should be mostly unchanged (hence, API should remain pretty stable)

* Future patterns in futures file; patterns like minder

* Maybe add the ability to automagically calculate interest.. Be^(rt) and all..
