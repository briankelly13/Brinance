* Maybe add the ability to automagically calculate interest.. Be^(rt) and all..

* GTK - use glade..

* -u/--undo -> undo last transaction
* past transaction editting via menu?
* release iank's updates (POD, distro and more!)

* remove documentation of brinance script subroutines?
* related -- document command line usage in POD so man page looks good

* use fixed point math
  - amounts are currently read in as strings to begin with, then converted to floating point

* add last_updates file, so we don't re-write futures every time (potentially clearing it accidentally)
