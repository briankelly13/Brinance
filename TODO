* GTK - use glade..

* -u/--undo -> undo last transaction
* past transaction editting via menu?
* release iank's updates (POD, distro and more!)

* remove documentation of brinance script subroutines?
* related -- document command line usage in POD so man page looks good

* use fixed point math
  - amounts are currently read in as strings to begin with, then converted to floating point

* redo command-line using Getopt::Long
  - non-options: keep adding to transaction description, less quoting required

* reasonable/standard error handling

* FEATURE: BRINANCE_DATE env variable; assumes it's the current date
  - shorter date: BRINANCE_DATE=201712 assumes all transactions occur in 2017/12
  - maybe a better way? want some way to assume part of the date
