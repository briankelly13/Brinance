 How to hack brinance
======================

   Brinance is written in Perl, and it's fairly simple code.

**File format

   The file format has changed pretty drastically in version 4. Now there is
only one file for all normal past and future transactions in all accounts. Now
all the information for the transaction is on one line, including the account to
which it applies. Future and past transactions are in the same file, and are
only differentiated by the code as being before the requested date or after (the
same date is considered to be before).
   A line looks like so:

<date> <account> <amount> <description>

       <date>: 12-digit time stamp, out to the minute; noon on June 27th, 1981 is 198106271200
    <account>: the brinance account number; a positive integer, usually a very low number
     <amount>: the amount to add to the balance, positive for credits, negative for debits
<description>: freeform text to describe the transaction

   The space between elements can be whatever Perl thinks \s is. By default,
brinance writes a single tab between each field, but it could be any
non-breaking white-space.
