* 20030807 - Minor: using strict pragma now, and had to fix some things for
that
             Moderate: Fixed another bug in +<days> system if you added a number
of days so that it would carry over into the month column. Now we don't add the
days together until we've pulled fields in the date apart
             Moderate: In fixing the last bug, uncovered another problem with
the leap year system.. worked it out..

* 20030702 - Fixed date bug when specifying days in the future (+(days)
	notation) for futurebalance and futuretrans subs
