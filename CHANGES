* 20031021 - Minor: grab the user's home dir much more cleanly and Perl-ly

* 20030913 - Trivial: cleaned up comments and added a couple notes of
documentation. Final cleanups before tearing it apart again to modularize
it.

* 20030821 - Minor: removed dependence on Number::Format. More people should be
able to run brinance now, as Number::Format doesn't seem to be a very common
installation package on UNIX systems. Thanks to Gong Li!
             Minor: Small documentation corrections and additions. Added an
AUTHORS file.

* 20030807 - Minor: using strict pragma now, and had to fix some things for
that
             Moderate: Fixed another bug in +<days> system if you added a number
of days so that it would carry over into the month column. Now we don't add the
days together until we've pulled fields in the date apart
             Moderate: In fixing the last bug, uncovered another problem with
the leap year system.. worked it out..

* 20030702 - Fixed date bug when specifying days in the future (+(days)
notation) for futurebalance and futuretrans subs
