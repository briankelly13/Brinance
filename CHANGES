* 20031205 - Fixed a serious bug with account numbers. If you put a leading zero
on the account number ("brinance -00 -b") it could erase all transactions in the
file. Very simple fix.

* 20031112 - Changed some subroutine names to be 'dated' instead of 'future'

* 20031027 - Cleaned up some module API issues
             Added module documentation in a SPEC file

* 20031026 - Fixed some warnings about un-initialized variables

* 20031021 - Got the module complete functionally. Final testing. The
command-line interface has an improved option system. It now accepts option
groupings (e.g. -b1b instead of -b -1 -b), but the old way still works
fine.
             Changed the version number scheme slightly to be more
CPAN-friendly.

* 20030917 - Beginnings of making it a module. Writing a new command-line
interface to test out the module.

* 20030913 - Trivial: cleaned up comments and added a couple notes of
documentation. Final cleanups before tearing it apart again to modularize
it.

* 20030821 - Minor: removed dependence on Number::Format. More people should be
able to run brinance now, as Number::Format doesn't seem to be a very common
installation package on UNIX systems. Thanks to Gong Li!
             Minor: Small documentation corrections and additions. Added an
AUTHORS file.

* 20030807 - Minor: using strict pragma now, and had to fix some things for
that
             Moderate: Fixed another bug in +<days> system if you added a number
of days so that it would carry over into the month column. Now we don't add the
days together until we've pulled fields in the date apart
             Moderate: In fixing the last bug, uncovered another problem with
the leap year system.. worked it out..
             
* 20030702 - Fixed date bug when specifying days in the future (+<days>
notation) for futurebalance and futuretrans subs
