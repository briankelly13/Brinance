 How to install brinance
=========================

   Unfortunately, I haven't managed to figure out how to get brinance to install
in an automated fashion. The main jist is that the 'brinance' executable perl
script needs to go somewhere in your path, and the modules needs to go somewhere
where Perl can find it. I copy the executable to my local bin directory:

$ cp brinance ~/bin/
$ chmod 555 ~/bin/brinance

   You will also need a directory in your home directory for brinance to work
with its account files. By default, that's ~/.brinance/.

$ mkdir ~/.brinance/

   Now we get tricky. Brinance.pm, the module code, needs to go somewhere in
your Perl module path (the @INC variable in Perl). By default, we're keeping
this all local and single-user, so brinance allows the module code to be in your
Perl path anywhere, or in a lib directory off your accounts directory.

$ mkdir ~/.brinance/lib/
$ cp Brinance.pm ~/.brinance/lib/
$ chmod 444 ~/.brinance/lib/Brinance.pm

   If you would rather put it somewhere so everyone can get to it, I suggest
/usr/local/lib/site_perl. This module doesn't quite fit the CPAN standards and
conventions, though, so it doesn't fit well into any of their categories, but it
will function if you just plop the file in that directory. Do it if you like.
   I'll get a Makefile or more perl-ish install working sometime..
