 How to install brinance
=========================

   Easy way: run 'make install'.

   Unfortunately, with the modularization of brinance, it's gotten slightly
(only slightly) more complicated to install. Now we have two files to contend
with. Your 'brinance' executable still goes wherever you like in your path. I
put it in ~/exe/ with the rest of my own executables.

$ cp brinance ~/exe/
$ chmod 555 ~/exe/brinance

   You will also need a directory in your home directory for brinance to work
with its account files. By default, that's ~/.brinance/.

$ mkdir ~/.brinance/

   Now we get tricky. Brinance.pm, the module code, needs to go somewhere in
your Perl module path (the @INC variable in Perl). By default, we're keeping
this all local and single-user, so brinance allows the module code to be in your
path anywhere, or in a lib directory off your accounts directory.

$ mkdir ~/.brinance/lib/
$ cp Brinance.pm ~/.brinance/lib/
$ chmod 444 ~/.brinance/lib/Brinance.pm

   If you would rather put it somewhere so everyone can get to it, I suggest
/usr/lib/perl5/{Perl Version}/. This module doesn't quite fit the CPAN standards
and conventions, though, so it doesn't fit well into any of their categories,
but it will function if you just plop the file in that directory. Do it if you
like.
   Running 'make install' does all these things, in a default type way. The
makefile uses ~/bin/ rather than ~/exe/ (that's just my thing), but otherwise
it's the same. The point is, do it however you like.
